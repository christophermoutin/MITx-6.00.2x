"""
Write a function that meets the specifications below. You do not have to use dynamic programming.

Hint: You might want to use bin() on an int to get a string, get rid of the first two characters, add leading 0's as needed, and then convert it to a numpy array of ints. Type help(bin) in the console.

For example,

    If choices = [1,2,2,3] and total = 4 you should return either [0 1 1 0] or [1 0 0 1]
    If choices = [1,1,3,5,3] and total = 5 you should return [0 0 0 1 0]
    If choices = [1,1,1,9] and total = 4 you should return [1 1 1 0]

        * sum(result) is as small as possible
    In case of ties, returns any result that works.

    pick the one that gives sum(result*choices) closest 
    to total without going over.
